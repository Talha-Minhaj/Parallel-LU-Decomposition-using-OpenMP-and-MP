# Parallel-LU-Decomposition-using-OpenMP-and-MP
This project implements LU decomposition for a matrix, dividing it into a lower triangular (L) and upper triangular (U) matrix, with a goal of solving large linear systems more efficiently. This decomposition approach is useful in solving linear equations, inverting matrices, and computing determinants.
